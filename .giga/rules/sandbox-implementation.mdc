# sandbox-implementation

The sandbox implementation provides an isolated environment for idea exploration and progressive refinement through multiple states:

## Core State Management
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance Score: 85/100

- Progressive idea state transitions:
  - mentioned → Initial capture of concepts
  - exploring → Active investigation phase  
  - refined → Validated and detailed
  - ready_to_extract → Approved for production use
- Innovation level categorization:
  - practical: Direct implementation potential
  - moderate: Some complexity but feasible
  - experimental: Novel approaches requiring validation
- Source attribution tracking:
  - user_mention: Direct user input
  - ai_suggestion: Agent-generated content
  - collaborative: Combined human-AI development

## Isolation System
Path: frontend/src/store/sandboxStore.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

- Maintains strict separation between sandbox and production environments
- State isolation prevents contamination of production data
- Allows experimental iterations without impacting existing work
- Temporary storage for in-progress ideation
- Parallel exploration of multiple concept branches

## Idea Generation Pipeline
Path: backend/src/agents/ConversationalIdeaAgent.ts 
Importance Score: 90/100

- Socratic questioning pattern for idea development
- Natural language idea extraction from conversations
- Automatic recognition of novel concepts
- Progressive refinement through guided exploration
- Context preservation across multiple sessions
- Intelligent combination of related ideas

## Workflow Management 
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance Score: 75/100

- Staged progression through refinement states
- Validation gates between state transitions
- Automatic suggestion of next refinement steps
- Collaboration controls for multi-user ideation
- Version tracking for idea evolution

The sandbox implementation emphasizes safe experimentation while maintaining clear pathways for promoting validated ideas to production use.
