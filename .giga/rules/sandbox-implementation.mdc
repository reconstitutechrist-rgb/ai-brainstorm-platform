# sandbox-implementation

The sandbox implementation manages idea progression through defined states with specialized algorithms for idea generation and refinement.

## Core Components

### State Management System
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance Score: 90/100

- Progressive idea refinement workflow with states:
  - mentioned: Initial capture of raw ideas
  - exploring: Active investigation/discussion
  - refined: Validated and detailed
  - ready_to_extract: Approved for project integration
- Innovation level classification:
  - practical: Direct implementation potential
  - moderate: Some adaptation needed
  - experimental: Requires significant exploration
- Source attribution tracking:
  - user_mention: Directly from participants
  - ai_suggestion: Generated by system
  - collaborative: Combined input sources

### Idea Generation Engine 
Path: frontend/src/components/canvas/VisualCanvas.tsx
Importance Score: 85/100

- Spatial organization system for brainstorming items
- Auto-positioning algorithm with isolation guarantees
- State-based visualization rules:
  - mentioned: Light highlighting
  - exploring: Active emphasis
  - refined: Clear visual structure
  - ready_to_extract: Prominent display

### Capacity Management
Path: frontend/src/components/canvas/CapacityWarning.tsx
Importance Score: 75/100

- Workspace capacity monitoring with thresholds:
  - Warning levels: critical/warning/info
  - Dynamic suggestion generation
  - Auto-scaling workspace management
- State-specific capacity limits to prevent overwhelming
