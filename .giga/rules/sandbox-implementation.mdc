# sandbox-implementation

The sandbox implementation provides an isolated ideation environment with structured state progression and context management.

## Core Components

### State Management System
Location: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance: 90/100

Implements four-stage idea progression workflow:
- mentioned -> Initial capture of ideas from conversation
- exploring -> Active investigation and refinement
- refined -> Vetted and clarified concepts
- ready_to_extract -> Ideas approved for project integration

State transitions require:
- Confirmation of source citations
- Context preservation
- Topic classification confidence score
- Innovation level assessment

### Context Isolation Engine
Location: frontend/src/components/sandbox/SessionReviewModal.tsx
Importance: 85/100

Manages sandbox environment isolation:
- Maintains separate conversation context from main project
- Tracks idea relationships and dependencies
- Preserves citation links across state transitions
- Controls promotion of ideas to main project space

### Idea Clustering System
Location: frontend/src/hooks/useClustering.ts 
Importance: 80/100

Implements dynamic idea organization:
- Topic-based clustering using conversation context
- Confidence scoring for topic assignments
- Progressive refinement of clusters
- Automatic positioning based on semantic relationships

### Extraction Workflow
Location: frontend/src/components/sandbox/ExtractionPanel.tsx
Importance: 85/100

Controls idea promotion to main project:
- Validation of required citations
- Context preservation during transfer
- State mapping from sandbox to project
- Relationship maintenance across contexts

The sandbox system enforces strict isolation while allowing controlled promotion of refined ideas into the main project space, with emphasis on context preservation and citation tracking throughout the ideation lifecycle.
