description: Technical specification for sandbox implementation, focused on idea generation and state progression workflows

# sandbox-implementation

The sandbox environment implements an isolated ideation workflow with progressive state refinement:

## State Management
- Ideas progress through 4 distinct states:
  - mentioned: Initial capture from conversations/research
  - exploring: Under active consideration and refinement
  - refined: Vetted and validated ideas
  - ready_to_extract: Approved for project integration

## Idea Generation Pipeline
- Direction-based ideation algorithms:
  - innovative: Focuses on novel approaches
  - practical: Emphasizes feasible solutions
  - experimental: Explores edge cases
  - budget: Cost-optimized alternatives 
  - premium: Feature-rich solutions

## State Isolation
- Sandbox maintains isolated state from main project
- Ideas can be freely explored without impacting project state
- Custom metadata tracks idea evolution and relationships
- State transitions trigger automated validation checks

## Extraction System
- Smart extraction pipeline for promoting ideas:
  - Source attribution tracking
  - Confidence scoring (0-100)
  - Innovation level classification
  - Implementation feasibility assessment
  - Resource requirement estimation

## Progressive Refinement
- Ideas require minimum quality thresholds to advance states
- AI agents provide targeted refinement suggestions
- Cross-reference validation against existing project items
- Automatic relationship detection between related ideas
- Impact analysis for potential conflicts

Importance Score: 85/100
