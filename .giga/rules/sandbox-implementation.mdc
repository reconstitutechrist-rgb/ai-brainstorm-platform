description: Specification for sandbox idea exploration system with progressive refinement states and isolation mechanics
---


# sandbox-implementation

The sandbox system implements a progressive idea refinement workflow with strict state isolation:

## Core Sandbox States
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance Score: 85

- Four distinct idea states with controlled transitions:
  1. mentioned: Initial capture of raw ideas
  2. exploring: Active investigation and development
  3. refined: Validated and detailed concepts
  4. ready_to_extract: Approved for project integration

- Innovation classification system:
  - practical: Direct implementation potential
  - moderate: Medium-term feasibility
  - experimental: Long-term exploration

## State Isolation Engine
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/ChatInterface.tsx
Importance Score: 90

- Conversation modes for controlled ideation:
  - exploration: Free-form idea generation
  - clarification: Concept refinement
  - generation: Structured ideation
  - refinement: Detail enhancement
  - comparison: Alternative analysis
  - validation: Assumption testing
  - implementation: Execution planning

- Context-aware prompt suggestion system maps user intent to appropriate conversation modes

## Idea Source Tracking
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/IdeaBoardPanel.tsx
Importance Score: 75

Three origin categories with distinct handling:
1. user_mention: Direct participant suggestions
2. ai_suggestion: Agent-generated concepts
3. collaborative: Combined human-AI refinements

The system maintains strict separation between sandbox explorations and main project state until explicit extraction approval, ensuring experimental safety while enabling creative freedom.
