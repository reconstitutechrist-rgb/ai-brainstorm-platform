# sandbox-implementation

## Idea State Management 
Importance Score: 95/100

The sandbox implements a four-state idea progression system:
1. mentioned - Initial capture from conversations
2. exploring - Active refinement and evaluation
3. refined - Vetted and enhanced ideas
4. ready_to_extract - Validated for project integration

Each state transition requires validation by quality control agents.

## Idea Generation Pipeline
Importance Score: 90/100

Located in `backend/src/agents/IdeaGeneratorAgent.ts`:

- Directional idea generation with categories:
  - Innovative (breakthrough solutions)
  - Practical (implementation-focused)
  - Budget (cost-optimized)
  - Premium (feature-rich)
  - Experimental (cutting-edge)

- Idea refinement workflows:
  - Context preservation across iterations
  - Assumption validation
  - Dependency tracking
  - Resource requirement analysis
  - Implementation risk assessment

## Conversational Interface
Importance Score: 85/100

Located in `backend/src/agents/ConversationalIdeaAgent.ts`:

- Natural language idea extraction
- Dynamic mode switching:
  - Brainstorming
  - Refinement
  - Validation
  - Combination
- Context-aware response generation
- Automatic tagging and categorization

## Sandbox Isolation
Importance Score: 80/100

- Complete state isolation from main project
- Parallel idea versions management
- Controlled extraction process with validation
- Reference material integration
- Version conflict resolution

## Idea Combination Engine
Importance Score: 75/100

- Smart merging of complementary ideas
- Conflict detection
- Synergy identification
- Resource optimization
- Implementation feasibility scoring
