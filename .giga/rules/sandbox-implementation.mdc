# sandbox-implementation

## Core Components

1. Idea Generation Workflow
Path: backend/src/agents/IdeaGeneratorAgent.ts
Importance: 95/100

- Implements five directional idea generation modes:
  - Practical: Cost-effective, immediate implementation focus
  - Premium: High-end, feature-rich solutions 
  - Innovative: Novel approaches and technologies
  - Budget: Minimal resource requirements
  - Experimental: Exploratory concepts

2. State Management
Path: frontend/src/store/sandboxStore.ts
Importance: 90/100

- Maintains four progressive idea states:
  - mentioned: Initial capture of raw concepts
  - exploring: Active investigation and expansion
  - refined: Validated and enhanced ideas
  - ready_to_extract: Finalized for project integration

3. Isolation Layer
Path: backend/src/services/sandboxService.ts
Importance: 85/100

- Creates isolated environment for risk-free ideation
- Maintains separate context from main project state
- Implements temporary storage for in-progress ideas
- Handles selective synchronization with project context

4. Refinement Pipeline
Path: backend/src/agents/sandbox/refinementAgent.ts
Importance: 80/100

- Analyzes idea feasibility and alignment
- Suggests combinations between related concepts
- Identifies potential blockers and dependencies
- Generates enhancement recommendations

5. Extraction Workflow
Path: backend/src/services/extractionService.ts
Importance: 75/100

- Validates ideas against project constraints
- Maps sandbox concepts to project structure
- Handles context preservation during extraction
- Manages citation and reference tracking
