# intent-classification-system

Core system for classifying conversation intents and orchestrating AI agent responses based on detected patterns.

## Intent Classification Engine
Importance Score: 95/100

Located in `backend/src/agents/conversation.ts`:

Primary intents:
- Brainstorming: Open-ended idea generation
- Clarification: Question refinement and assumption validation 
- Verification: Fact-checking and reference validation
- Development: Technical implementation details
- Strategic: High-level planning and architecture

Classification triggers:
- Question structure analysis
- Keyword pattern matching
- Context chain evaluation
- Previous interaction history
- Reference material relevance

## Workflow Determination
Importance Score: 90/100

Located in `backend/src/agents/orchestrator.ts`:

Decision paths:
```
EXPLORE_MODE:
  brainstorm -> clarify -> verify -> develop

REFINE_MODE:
  verify -> clarify -> strategic -> develop

VALIDATE_MODE:
  verify -> reference -> clarify -> strategic
```

State transitions controlled by:
- Intent confidence scores
- Question completion status
- Dependency resolution
- Context preservation rules
- Agent availability

## Agent Selection Logic
Importance Score: 85/100

Agent matching based on:
- Primary intent classification
- Secondary intent signals
- Current project phase
- Previous agent interactions
- Context requirements

Agent coordination patterns:
- Sequential for dependent tasks
- Parallel for compatible intents
- Fallback chains for low confidence
- Recovery paths for failed responses
