# intent-classification-system

## Core Intent Classification Pipeline
Importance Score: 95/100

Primary intent classification system identifies and routes conversations through 9 distinct modes:

1. Brainstorming Intent
- Free-form ideation mode
- Pattern matching for creative exploration markers
- Automatic transition to refinement when ideas stabilize

2. Decision Intent
- Consensus-seeking conversation patterns
- Citation and reference requirements enforced
- Blocks progression without sufficient support data

3. Research Intent
- Triggers multi-agent research coordination
- Automatic query refinement based on context
- Research coverage scoring system

4. Exploring Intent
- Open-ended investigation patterns
- Maintains idea state machine transitions
- Links related concepts for clustering

## Workflow Mapping Engine
Importance Score: 85/100

Conversation analysis drives workflow transitions through:

1. State Management
- Tracking mentioned → exploring → refined → ready_to_extract states
- Automatic state transitions based on conversation markers
- Prevents invalid state transitions

2. Agent Selection
- Routes conversations to specialized agents based on intent
- Parallel agent execution for compatible intents
- Automatic handoff between agent types

## Conditional Execution Patterns
Importance Score: 80/100

1. Intent-Based Routing
- Routes to specific agent combinations based on detected intent
- Enforces agent specialization hierarchy
- Manages context sharing between agents

2. State-Based Actions
- Triggers automatic actions based on conversation state
- Enforces business rules for state transitions
- Manages parallel processing of compatible states
