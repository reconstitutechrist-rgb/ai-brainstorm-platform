# intent-classification-system

## Core Intent Classification
Path: frontend/src/components/sandbox/ChatInterface.tsx
Importance Score: 90

The system implements conversation mode detection and adaptation across 7 distinct modes:
- exploration: Open-ended ideation and discovery
- clarification: Resolving ambiguity and gathering details  
- generation: Creating specific outputs or solutions
- refinement: Improving and iterating on ideas
- comparison: Evaluating alternatives
- validation: Verifying assumptions and decisions
- implementation: Converting ideas to actionable plans

## Context-Aware Workflow Mapping 
Path: backend/src/agents/orchestrator.ts
Importance Score: 85

Intelligent workflow determination based on:
1. Message intent classification 
2. Project phase indicators
3. Current conversation context
4. Historical interaction patterns

Workflow mapping triggers specialized agent combinations for:
- Initial exploration sequences
- Deep-dive analysis paths
- Validation/verification chains
- Implementation guidance flows

## Agent Execution Patterns
Path: backend/src/agents/ContextManagerAgent.ts
Importance Score: 80

Conditional agent execution based on:
1. Intent confidence scoring
2. Required verification levels
3. Context preservation rules
4. Agent coordination patterns

The system maintains conversation state tracking with:
- Active intent classification
- Context carryover rules
- Mode transition triggers
- Agent activation conditions
