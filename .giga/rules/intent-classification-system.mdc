## Core Intent Classification Components

### Intent Classification Workflow
Importance Score: 95/100
- Implements specialized multi-agent orchestration based on detected conversation intents
- Routes conversations through appropriate agent sequences:
  - Questioner -> Clarification -> Gap Detection
  - Brainstorming -> Verification -> Assumption Blocker
  - Reviewer -> Quality Auditor
- Dynamic workflow determination based on conversation context
- Parallel vs sequential processing decisions based on intent dependencies

### Conversation State Management
Importance Score: 90/100
- Maintains three primary conversation modes:
  - Exploration (open ideation)
  - Refinement (idea development)
  - Decision (formalization)
- State transitions triggered by detected intent patterns
- Context preservation across mode switches
- Progressive idea refinement tracking

### Response Pattern Selection 
Importance Score: 85/100
- Matches agent response patterns to detected intents:
  - Questioning patterns for unclear concepts
  - Clarification sequences for ambiguous ideas
  - Validation flows for decision points
- Dynamically adjusts response depth based on conversation mode
- Enforces consistency in multi-agent response chains

### Document Integration Flow
Importance Score: 80/100
- Links conversation intents to relevant documentation:
  - Reference material connections
  - Decision record attachments
  - Context documentation
- Routes document-related queries to specialized agents
- Maintains citation tracking through intent transitions

The system's core value lies in its sophisticated intent classification that drives agent orchestration, conversation flow, and document integration. The multi-stage classification process ensures appropriate agent selection and response patterns while maintaining contextual awareness across transitions.
