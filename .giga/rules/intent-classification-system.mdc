# intent-classification-system

Core intent classification system with 9 distinct conversation modes:

1. Research Intent Processing
- Classification of queries into research, document_discovery, gap_analysis
- Source selection algorithm based on intent mapping:
  - research → web + docs
  - document_discovery → docs only 
  - gap_analysis → metadata analysis

2. Workflow Mapping
- Intent-based agent selection and orchestration
- Agent execution patterns based on intent:
  - Research intents → Research + Context agents
  - Technical intents → Expert + Verification agents
  - Creative intents → Brainstorm + Refiner agents

3. Agent Execution Rules
- Sequential agent execution for dependent intents
- Parallel execution for compatible agents:
  - Research + Context allowed
  - Expert + Research allowed
  - Verification always last

4. Intent Transition Logic
- State machine for conversation flow:
  - research → document_discovery
  - document_discovery → gap_analysis
  - research → verification
- Context preservation between transitions
- Intent inheritance across related queries

5. Classification Confidence
- Intent scoring (0-100) based on:
  - Keyword matches
  - Context alignment
  - Historical patterns
- Threshold-based intent selection:
  - >85: Direct execution
  - 60-85: Agent confirmation
  - <60: User clarification

Key domain-specific components:
- 9 core conversation intents
- Intent-based workflow mapping
- Agent execution orchestration
- Transition state machine
- Confidence scoring system

Importance Score: 90/100
