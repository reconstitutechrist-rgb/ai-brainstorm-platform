# intent-classification-system

Importance Score: 85/100

The intent classification system implements multi-stage conversation analysis and agent orchestration:

## Core Intent Classification Pipeline

1. Primary Intent Categories:
- Research mode (document discovery, gap analysis, technical review)
- Ideation mode (exploration, refinement, extraction)
- Decision mode (evaluation, confirmation, rejection)
- Clarification mode (blocker resolution, question handling)

2. Context-Aware Classification Logic:
```
frontend/src/components/research/ResearchChatPanel.tsx
```
- Automatic research mode determination based on conversation context
- Real-time intent adjustment based on user responses
- Multi-agent consensus for intent verification
- Confidence scoring for intent classification

3. Workflow Mapping System:
```
backend/src/agents/orchestrator.ts
```
- Maps classified intents to specific agent workflows
- Dynamic agent selection based on conversation needs
- Parallel agent execution for independent verifications
- Context preservation between agent handoffs

4. Decision Flow Orchestration:
```
backend/src/services/sessionCompletionService.ts
```
- Natural language decision parsing with intent classification
- Automated conflict detection between decisions
- Citation requirement enforcement based on intent
- Multi-step review process for critical decisions

## Intent-Based Agent Selection

1. Agent Types by Intent:
- Research Agent: Document analysis, gap identification
- Strategic Agent: Vision alignment, requirement mapping
- Verification Agent: Assumption checking, citation validation
- Clarification Agent: Question generation, blocker resolution

2. Selection Rules:
- Research intents trigger parallel document analysis
- Decision intents require verification agent review
- Clarification intents activate question-answer workflow
- Strategic intents engage long-term planning analysis

## State Management

1. Intent Tracking:
```
frontend/src/store/agentStore.ts
```
- Maintains current and historical intents per session
- Tracks intent transitions and agent responses
- Maps intent sequences to outcome patterns
- Preserves context between related intents

2. Workflow Progress:
- Stage-based progression through intent sequences
- Automatic blocking on critical clarifications
- Intent-based suggestion generation
- Context pruning for completed workflows
