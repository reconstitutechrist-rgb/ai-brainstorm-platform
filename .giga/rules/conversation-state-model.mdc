## Three-State Decision System
Importance Score: 95/100

Conversation states are managed through a three-state decision model:
- Decided: Finalized decisions with full context and citations
- Exploring: Active discussions requiring additional input
- Parked: Temporarily suspended topics pending blockers

State transitions follow strict rules:
```
Exploring -> Decided: Requires verification agent approval
Exploring -> Parked: Triggered by blocker detection
Parked -> Exploring: Requires blocker resolution
```

## Context Pruning System 
Importance Score: 85/100

Implements intelligent conversation history management:
- Retains most recent 3 state transitions per topic
- Preserves critical decision points with citations
- Maintains cross-references between related topics
- Prunes redundant context while preserving decision chains

## Cache Invalidation
Importance Score: 80/100

Conversation cache management rules:
- Invalidates on state transitions
- Preserves context for related topics
- Maintains agent-specific context windows
- Implements selective pruning based on topic relevance

## State Transition Validation
Importance Score: 75/100

Enforces strict state change rules:
- Requires confidence scores above 0.85 for decisions
- Mandates citation tracking for state changes
- Validates assumption checks before transitions
- Maintains audit trail of state history
