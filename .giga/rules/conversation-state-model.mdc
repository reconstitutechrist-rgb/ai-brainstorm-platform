# conversation-state-model

The conversation state management system implements a sophisticated three-state decision tracking model with intelligent context pruning.

Core Components:

1. Three-State Decision System (Importance: 90/100)
- States: decided/exploring/parked
- Tracking of state transitions with reasoning capture
- Citation mapping between related decisions
- Confidence scoring for state changes
- Automatic state suggestions based on conversation context

2. Context Pruning Rules (Importance: 85/100) 
- Agent-specific context retention policies
- Task-based context preservation
- Adaptive pruning based on conversation importance
- Decision-focused pruning for consistency validation

3. Cache Invalidation System (Importance: 80/100)
- Dynamic TTL calculations per agent type
- Token-based cache expiration 
- Context-aware cache refresh triggers
- Progressive cache pruning based on memory usage

4. State Transition Workflows (Importance: 75/100)
- Citation tracking for decision changes
- Version control on state modifications
- Conflict detection across state changes
- Automatic state recommendations

The system maintains conversation coherence through intelligent context management while optimizing memory usage through sophisticated pruning algorithms. Each state transition is tracked with full citation history and confidence scoring.
