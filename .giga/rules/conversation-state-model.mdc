# Conversation State Model
## Overview
The conversation state model manages how ideas and decisions progress through the brainstorming lifecycle. The system uses a **three-state model** (decided, exploring, parked) with intelligent state transitions driven by intent classification and context-aware approval detection.
**Key Features:**
- Automatic state transitions based on user signals
- Pre-verification before recording decisions
- Context-aware approval detection (distinguishing genuine decisions from acknowledgments)
- Batch recording via review workflow
- Simple approval shortcuts for efficiency
- Cache invalidation on state changes
## The Three States
### 1. Decided
**Definition:** Ideas that have been explicitly chosen for implementation or adoption.
**Characteristics:**
- High confidence in the decision
- User explicitly confirmed selection
- Ready for action/implementation
- Appears in "Decided Ideas" section
**Entry Signals:**
- "I want to use [idea]"
- "Let's go with [approach]"
- "Yes" (after AI suggestion)
- "Perfect, that's exactly what we need"
- "Let's implement [solution]"
**State Behavior:**
- Recorded by PersistenceManagerAgent with verification
- Triggers cache invalidation
- May trigger strategic planning workflow
- Marked with `status: 'decided'` in database
### 2. Exploring
**Definition:** Ideas actively being investigated, refined, or considered.
**Characteristics:**
- Under active discussion
- Not yet committed to
- May evolve or change
- Appears in "Exploring Ideas" section
**Entry Signals:**
- "What if we tried [idea]?"
- "Maybe we could [approach]"
- "Let's think about [option]"
- "I'm curious about [concept]"
**State Behavior:**
- More permissive validation rules
- Can be freely modified or discarded
- Encourages open exploration
- Marked with `status: 'exploring'` in database
### 3. Parked
**Definition:** Ideas temporarily set aside for later consideration.
**Characteristics:**
- Not currently active
- Preserved for future reference
- Not abandoned permanently
- Appears in "Parked Ideas" section
**Entry Signals:**
- "Let's park this for now"
- "Come back to this later"
- "Set this aside"
- "Table this discussion"
**State Behavior:**
- Minimal validation required
- Can be reactivated to exploring state
- Preserved in conversation history
- Marked with `status: 'parked'` in database

## Verification Modes
### Permissive Mode
**Used for:**
- Brainstorming workflows
- Exploring workflows
**Behavior:**
- More lenient validation
- Records ideas without strict confirmation
- Assumes user wants to capture thoughts
- Allows rapid idea generation
**Validation Checks:**
- Idea has substance (not empty)
- Not duplicate of recent idea
- Contains actionable content
### Balanced Mode
**Used for:**
- Deciding workflows
- Modifying workflows
**Behavior:**
- Stricter validation rules
- Requires clear decision signals
- Pre-verifies before recording
- Context-aware approval detection
**Validation Checks:**
- Explicit decision language present
- Not just acknowledgment of AI response
- Clear selection among alternatives
- Actionable decision made
## Context-Aware Approval Detection
### The Challenge
Distinguishing between:
- **Genuine Decision:** "Yes, let's use React for the frontend"
- **Acknowledgment:** "Yes, I see what you mean"
### Detection Algorithm
The ContextManager analyzes:
1. **Previous AI Message Content**
   - Did AI make a specific suggestion?
   - Did AI present options/alternatives?
2. **User Response Context**
   - Is response immediately after AI suggestion?
   - Does response reference specific suggestion?
   - Contains elaboration beyond "yes"?
3. **Decision Markers**
   - References specific option: "Let's go with option A"
   - Contains reasoning: "Yes, because..."
   - Adds details: "Yes, and we should also..."
   - Expresses commitment: "I want to proceed with..."
### Example: Context-Aware Decision
```
AI: "I suggest using PostgreSQL for better relational data handling. Would you like to proceed?"
User: "Yes"
Analysis:
- Previous message: AI made specific suggestion (PostgreSQL)
- User response: Single word after suggestion
- Context: Clear decision signal
- Result: DECIDED state, record "Use PostgreSQL"
```
```
AI: "That approach could work well for your use case."
User: "Yes"
Analysis:
- Previous message: AI acknowledged user idea (no specific suggestion)
- User response: Simple acknowledgment
- Context: Not a decision point
- Result: EXPLORING state, no recording
```
## Recording Workflow
### Standard Recording Flow
1. **Intent Classification**
   - ContextManager analyzes message
   - Determines appropriate intent
2. **Workflow Execution**
   - Orchestrator runs intent-based workflow
   - ConversationAgent generates response
   - QualityAuditor validates (if applicable)
3. **Pre-Verification**
   - PersistenceManager checks if recording appropriate
   - Applies mode-specific validation rules
   - Evaluates context-aware signals
4. **Recording Decision**
   - **Record:** If verification passes and decision detected
   - **Skip:** If acknowledgment or unclear decision
   - **Hold:** If requires user clarification
5. **State Update**
   - Update conversation state
   - Invalidate relevant caches
   - Log state transition
### Review-Based Recording
The ReviewerAgent can process conversation history in batch:
1. **User Triggers Review**
   - Command: "review conversation"
   - Or: Automatic periodic review
2. **ReviewerAgent Analysis**
   - Scans full conversation history
   - Identifies missed decisions/ideas
   - Extracts implicit decisions
   - Groups related ideas
3. **Batch Presentation**
   - Presents found items to user
   - User confirms/rejects each
   - User can edit before recording
4. **Batch Recording**
   - PersistenceManager records confirmed items
   - Assigns appropriate states
   - Updates conversation metadata
## Simple Approval Shortcuts
### Feature: Fast Responses for Simple Approvals
When user sends single-word affirmatives without context:
- "ok"
- "sure"
- "thanks"
- "got it"
**Behavior:**
- System provides brief acknowledgment
- **No Claude API call** (saves cost/time)
- Response time: <100ms
- Minimal token usage
**Implementation:**
```typescript
const simpleAffirmatives = ['ok', 'okay', 'sure', 'thanks', 'got it', 'understood'];
const isSimpleApproval = simpleAffirmatives.includes(message.trim().toLowerCase());
if (isSimpleApproval && !previousAISuggestion) {
  return { response: "Understood!", skipClaude: true };
}
```
**Exceptions (still call Claude):**
- Simple "yes" after AI suggestion (potential decision)
- Follows up previous question
- Part of ongoing decision process
## Cache Invalidation
### Cache Invalidation Triggers
The ResponseCache invalidates entries when:
1. **State Changes**
   - exploring → decided
   - decided → exploring
   - Any transition to/from parked
2. **Explicit Edits**
   - User edits decision text
   - User deletes decision
   - User changes decision state
3. **Agent-Specific Triggers**
   - PersistenceManager: After any recording
   - ContextManager: After state transition
   - ConversationAgent: After explicit edit
4. **Batch Invalidation**
   - Review workflow completion
   - Project-wide state change
   - Manual cache clear
### Invalidation Scope
**Agent-Specific Invalidation:**
```typescript
cache.invalidate('persistence_manager'); // Only PersistenceManager cache
```
**Full Invalidation:**
```typescript
cache.invalidateAll(); // All agent caches
```
**Selective Invalidation:**
```typescript
cache.invalidateMatching({ state: 'decided' }); // All decided-state caches
```
## Integration with Intent Classification
### Intent → State Mapping
| Intent | Default State | Verification Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| brainstorming | exploring | permissive |
| deciding | decided | balanced |
| modifying | exploring | balanced |
| parking | parked | permissive |
| questioning | exploring | permissive |
| exploring | exploring | permissive |
| reviewing | (varies) | balanced |
| development | exploring | balanced |
| general | (none) | N/A |
### Multi-Intent Handling
When multiple intents detected:
1. **Primary Intent**
   - Strongest confidence score
   - Determines workflow
2. **Secondary Intents**
   - Logged for context
   - May influence verification
   - Noted in conversation metadata
**Example:**
```
Message: "I like option A, but let's park option B for later"
Intents Detected:
- Primary: deciding (85% confidence) → decided state
- Secondary: parking (75% confidence) → note to park option B
Action:
- Record option A as decided
- Record option B as parked
```
## State Persistence
### Database Storage
**conversations table:**
```sql
{
  conversation_state: 'decided' | 'exploring' | 'parked',
  last_state_change: timestamp,
  state_history: jsonb
}
```
**project_items table:**
```sql
{
  status: 'decided' | 'exploring' | 'parked',
  decision_confidence: float,
  decision_timestamp: timestamp,
  verification_mode: 'permissive' | 'balanced'
}
```
### State History Tracking
Each state change recorded:
```typescript
{
  from_state: 'exploring',
  to_state: 'decided',
  timestamp: '2025-10-28T10:30:00Z',
  trigger: 'user_explicit',
  confidence: 0.95,
  message_id: 'msg_123'
}
```
## Performance Characteristics
**State Transition Time:**
- Intent classification: 200-500ms
- Verification: 50-100ms
- Recording: 100-200ms
- Total: <1 second
**Cache Impact:**
- State change invalidates 5-10 cache entries
- Revalidation: 1-3 seconds for affected agents
- Hit rate after invalidation: Recovers within 2-3 requests
