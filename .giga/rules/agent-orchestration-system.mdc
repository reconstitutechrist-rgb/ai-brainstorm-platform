# agent-orchestration-system

## Core Agent Architecture

The system orchestrates 17 specialized AI agents organized in 4 tiers:

### Primary Agents (Tier 1)
- ResearchAgent: Drives document/web research workflows
- IdeationAgent: Handles creative exploration and refinement 
- ValidationAgent: Performs cross-reference verification
- SynthesisAgent: Combines multi-source insights

### Support Agents (Tier 2)
- QualityAgent: Multi-stage quality inspection
- GapAgent: Knowledge gap detection
- ClarificationAgent: Ambiguity resolution
- ConsistencyAgent: Cross-validation

### Specialized Agents (Tier 3)
- DocumentAgent: Template-based doc generation
- ReferenceAgent: Citation management
- PrioritizationAgent: Task ranking
- TranslationAgent: Format conversion

### Meta Agents (Tier 4)
- OrchestrationAgent: Cross-agent coordination
- ContextAgent: State/context management  
- ProgressAgent: Stage tracking
- BlockerAgent: Bottleneck detection
- IntegrationAgent: System-wide synthesis

## Workflow Patterns

1. Research Workflow
- ResearchAgent initiates queries
- GapAgent analyzes coverage
- ValidationAgent verifies sources
- SynthesisAgent combines findings

2. Document Generation
- DocumentAgent creates drafts
- QualityAgent reviews content
- ClarificationAgent resolves issues
- ConsistencyAgent ensures alignment

3. Ideation Process
- IdeationAgent generates concepts
- PrioritizationAgent ranks ideas
- ValidationAgent checks feasibility
- IntegrationAgent maps to project

## State Management

The OrchestrationAgent maintains:

1. Agent States
- active: Currently processing
- standby: Ready for tasks
- blocked: Awaiting dependencies

2. Context Management
- Project state snapshots
- Cross-agent memory
- Dependency tracking
- State transition logs

3. Progress Tracking
- Stage completion status
- Blocking conditions
- Resource utilization
- Agent synchronization
