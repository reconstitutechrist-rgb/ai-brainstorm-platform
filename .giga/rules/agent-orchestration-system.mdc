# agent-orchestration-system

## Core Orchestration Logic
Importance Score: 95/100

Multi-agent workflow engine coordinates 17 specialized AI agents through complex interaction patterns:

1. Agent Dependency Graph
- Research Agent → Analysis Agent → Strategy Agent
- Ideation Agent → Refinement Agent → Validation Agent
- Context Agent → Synthesis Agent → Document Agent

2. Workflow State Machine
- Sequential execution paths based on agent dependencies
- Parallel processing for independent verification tasks 
- Rollback capabilities for failed agent interactions

3. Context Management
- Progressive context pruning between agent handoffs
- Selective context propagation based on relevance
- Citation preservation across agent boundaries

4. Response Coordination
- Multi-agent consensus requirements for critical decisions
- Conflict resolution through specialized mediator agents
- Natural language synthesis of multi-agent outputs

## Agent Types and Roles

Research Pipeline:
- UnifiedResearchAgent: Multi-source research aggregation
- ReferenceAnalysisAgent: Document analysis and extraction
- GapAnalysisAgent: Missing information detection

Ideation Pipeline:
- IdeaGeneratorAgent: Creative concept generation
- RefinementAgent: Idea improvement and combination
- ValidationAgent: Zero-assumption verification

Analysis Pipeline:
- ContextAnalysisAgent: Topic grouping and relationships
- ConflictDetectionAgent: Decision consistency checking
- InsightExtractionAgent: Key finding identification

Document Pipeline:
- TemplateSynthesisAgent: Structured content generation
- CitationTrackingAgent: Reference management
- QualityAuditAgent: Output verification

Strategy Pipeline:
- VisionTranslationAgent: High-level goal interpretation
- RequirementsMappingAgent: Technical specification
- PriorityAssignmentAgent: Feature scoring
- ResourceAllocationAgent: Implementation planning
- DeliverySequencingAgent: Dependency management

## State Management Algorithm

1. Agent State Tracking:
- Active/Idle/Blocked status monitoring
- Resource utilization metrics
- Task queue management
- Timeout and retry handling

2. Workflow State:
- Session status tracking
- Conversation context preservation
- Decision state management
- Citation verification status
