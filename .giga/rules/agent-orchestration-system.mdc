# agent-orchestration-system

The 17-agent orchestration system implements a sophisticated workflow management architecture:

## Agent Dependency Graph
- Core coordination between Questioner, Clarification, and Gap Detection agents
- Recorder agent maintains decision history and verification chain
- Context Manager controls state transitions and workflow selection
- Quality Control agents (Auditor, Verification) operate as cross-cutting concerns
Importance Score: 95

## Workflow Orchestration 
- Dynamic agent selection based on conversation intent and project phase
- Parallel execution paths for independent agent tasks
- Sequential coordination for dependent operations
- State preservation across agent handoffs
Importance Score: 90

## Context Management
- Pruning system removes irrelevant context per agent type
- Session state tracking with immutable snapshots
- Selective context sharing between agent groups
- Project alignment verification before state changes
Importance Score: 85

## Agent Response Integration
- Multi-stage response consolidation pipeline
- Conflict resolution between agent outputs
- Priority-based message filtering
- Response confidence scoring
Importance Score: 80

## Execution Paths
- Exploration: Questioner → Gap Detection → Clarification
- Verification: Context → Auditor → Recorder
- Research: Search → Analysis → Integration
- Implementation: Planning → Task → Quality Check
Importance Score: 85

## State Management Algorithm
- Tracks agent availability and current tasks
- Manages blocked states and dependencies
- Handles rollback scenarios for failed workflows
- Maintains consistency across parallel operations
Importance Score: 90
