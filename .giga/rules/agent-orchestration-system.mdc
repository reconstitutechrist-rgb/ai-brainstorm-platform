# agent-orchestration-system

The 17-agent orchestration system implements a sophisticated AI collaboration framework with specialized roles and controlled interaction patterns.

## Core Agent Types (Importance: 95/100)

1. Orchestrator Agents
- Workflow coordination and agent task distribution 
- Dynamic routing based on conversation intent
- State management across agent handoffs
- Context preservation between interactions

2. Core Processing Agents
- Question Generation Agent
- Gap Detection Agent  
- Verification Agent
- Assumption Detection Agent
- Implementation Planning Agent
- Quality Control Agent

3. Support Agents
- Reference Analysis Agent
- Citation Tracking Agent
- Context Management Agent
- Capacity Monitoring Agent
- State Persistence Agent

## Agent Dependencies

Hierarchical Structure:
```
Orchestrator
├── Core Agents
│   ├── Question Generator
│   ├── Gap Detector 
│   └── Verifier
├── Support Agents
│   ├── Reference Analyzer
│   └── Context Manager
└── Quality Control
    ├── Assumption Detector
    └── Implementation Planner
```

## Workflow Patterns (Importance: 90/100)

1. Exploration Workflow
- Question Generator → Gap Detector → Verifier
- Context preservation between transitions
- Assumption detection gates

2. Decision Workflow  
- Verifier → Implementation Planner → Quality Control
- Reference validation requirements
- State transition rules

3. Research Workflow
- Reference Analyzer → Gap Detector → Question Generator
- Citation tracking integration
- Context enrichment paths

## State Management (Importance: 85/100)

Three primary states:
1. Exploring
- Active agent processing
- Context accumulation
- Citation gathering

2. Decided
- Verification complete
- Implementation plan created
- Dependencies mapped

3. Parked
- Temporary state suspension
- Context preservation
- Reactivation rules

## Agent Communication Protocol

1. Synchronous Patterns
- Direct agent-to-agent handoffs
- Context preservation requirements
- State validation gates

2. Asynchronous Patterns  
- Parallel processing workflows
- Non-blocking transitions
- State reconciliation rules
