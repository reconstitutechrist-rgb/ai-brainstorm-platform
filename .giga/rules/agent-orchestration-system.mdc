# agent-orchestration-system

## Core Orchestration Engine
Importance Score: 95/100

Path: `backend/src/agents/orchestrator.ts`

Coordinates 17 specialized AI agents through structured workflows:

Decision Workflow:
```
brainstorming -> verification -> assumptionBlocker -> 
consistencyGuardian -> recorder -> versionControl
```

Exploration Workflow:  
```
brainstorming -> gapDetection -> clarification ->
recorder (on gap resolution)
```

Implements:
- Dynamic workflow determination based on conversation intent
- Parallel agent execution for compatible tasks
- State transitions between decided/exploring/parked items
- Dependency resolution between agent outputs
- Citation tracking across agent decisions

## Agent State Management
Importance Score: 90/100

Path: `backend/src/services/agentCoordination.ts`

Manages:
- Conversation context scoping per agent type
- Project state integrity across parallel executions
- Decision confidence scoring
- State conflict resolution
- Invalid state transition rollbacks

## Agent Communication Protocol
Importance Score: 85/100

Path: `frontend/src/store/agentStore.ts`

Implements:
- Question-response workflow coordination
- Thread management between agents
- Question priority queueing
- Window state management based on question status
- Agent activity synchronization

## Decision Tracking
Importance Score: 80/100

Key workflows:
- Automatic state classification (decided/exploring/parked)
- Citation chain maintenance
- Assumption violation detection
- Contradiction identification
- Decision confidence scoring

The system maintains strict validation rules between states and requires consensus from verification agents before state transitions are committed.
