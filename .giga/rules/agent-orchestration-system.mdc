# agent-orchestration-system

The system orchestrates 17 specialized AI agents through coordinated workflows:

## Core Orchestration Components

1. Agent Controller
Path: backend/src/agents/orchestrator.ts
Importance Score: 95
- Manages parallel execution of agent tasks with dependency resolution
- Routes conversations through appropriate agent sequences based on intent
- Maintains context sharing between agent interactions
- Implements 8 distinct workflow patterns:
  - Brainstorming
  - Decision Making
  - Modification
  - Exploration
  - Review
  - Development
  - Parking
  - General Processing

2. Agent State Management
Path: backend/src/services/agentCoordination.ts
Importance Score: 90
- Three-state project management (Decided/Exploring/Parked)
- Citation tracking with automatic source attribution
- State transition validation with verification requirements
- Decision history tracking with full context preservation

3. Context Management
Path: backend/src/agents/contextManager.ts
Importance Score: 85
- Maps user input to appropriate workflow types
- Maintains conversation memory across agent handoffs
- Implements confidence scoring for intent classification
- Manages agent-specific context pruning rules

## Agent Categories

1. Core Agents
- Brainstorming Agent: Generates initial ideas
- Questioner Agent: Probes for clarification
- Recorder Agent: Documents decisions
- Context Manager: Maintains conversation state

2. Quality Agents
- Verification Agent: Validates assumptions
- Gap Detection: Identifies missing information
- Clarification Agent: Resolves ambiguities
- Accuracy Auditor: Checks factual correctness

3. Support Agents
- Consistency Guardian: Ensures alignment
- Translation Agent: Standardizes formats
- Prioritization Agent: Orders tasks
- Resource Manager: Tracks dependencies

4. Meta Agents
- Integration Orchestrator: Coordinates workflows
- State Manager: Tracks system status
- Version Control: Manages changes
- Documentation Generator: Creates artifacts

## Workflow Processing

1. Decision Recording
- Intent detection through agent analysis
- Assumption verification process
- Context validation checks
- Citation generation system
- State updates with verification

2. Reference Integration
- Content analysis by specialized agents
- Context mapping to existing decisions
- Relationship detection between references
- Integration with decision support system
