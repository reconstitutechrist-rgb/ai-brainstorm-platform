## Core Agent Orchestration Structure
Importance Score: 95/100

### Agent Categories & Roles
- Core Agents (5)
  - Research Coordinator: Manages document analysis and synthesis
  - Context Manager: Maintains conversation state and intent 
  - Decision Recorder: Validates and persists key decisions
  - Quality Auditor: Verifies assumptions and consistency
  - Strategic Planner: Handles technical translation and priorities

- Support Agents (8)
  - Reference Analyzer: Document parsing and extraction
  - Gap Detector: Identifies missing information
  - Assumption Validator: Flags unproven statements
  - Citation Checker: Verifies source claims
  - Consistency Monitor: Cross-reference validation
  - Implementation Scorer: Complexity assessment
  - Priority Manager: Dependency analysis
  - Format Converter: Data standardization

- Orchestrator Agents (4)
  - Workflow Director: Routes conversations based on intent
  - Parallel Coordinator: Manages concurrent agent execution
  - Context Pruner: Optimizes conversation state
  - State Manager: Handles agent lifecycle transitions

### State Management
- Agent States
  - IDLE: Available for new tasks
  - ACTIVE: Currently processing
  - BLOCKED: Waiting on dependencies
  - FAILED: Error condition
  - COMPLETED: Task finished

### Dependencies
- Hierarchical Structure
  - Level 1: Orchestrator agents
  - Level 2: Core agents 
  - Level 3: Support agents
  - Strict dependency order enforcement

### Workflow Patterns
- Sequential Processing
  1. Intent Classification
  2. Core Agent Assignment
  3. Support Agent Distribution
  4. Result Consolidation

- Parallel Execution
  - Compatible agents run concurrently
  - Automatic deadlock prevention
  - Resource allocation based on priority

### Communication Protocols
- Inter-agent messaging system
- Context preservation across transitions
- State synchronization mechanism
- Failure recovery patterns
